Facial Symmetry: Symmetrical faces are generally more attractive. Some degree of asymmetry may be acceptable as long as it does not detract from overall attractiveness.
Facial Age: Higher perceived facial age, especially above 35 or 40, tends to make a person less attractive.
Facial Features:
Hair: Well-maintained hair enhances attractiveness, while receding hairlines or baldness detract from it.
Forehead: Wrinkles on the forehead are associated with lower attractiveness.
Eyebrows: Well-groomed and proportionate eyebrows enhance facial attractiveness. Bushy or unkempt eyebrows may detract from it.
Eyes: Bright, expressive eyes enhance attractiveness, while droopy or tired-looking eyes may detract from it.
Nose: Symmetrical and proportionate noses contribute positively to attractiveness.
Lips: Full, symmetrical lips are often considered attractive, while thin or asymmetrical lips may detract from it.
Chin: Well-defined jawlines and proportionate chins contribute to attractiveness.
Cheeks: High cheekbones and a defined cheek structure are often associated with attractiveness.

Facial Weight: Excessive facial fat can diminish facial definition and perceived attractiveness.
